block {
    location
    color
}

piece {
    extends block

    shape
    rotation
    isPlayerControlled
    location of all blocks in piece
}

collision for each piece while player is moving
    -before rotation, check if all future positions of piece after rotation are empty/valid
    -before falling 1 unit, ^

Once falling has stopped, take control away from player

check if any rows that the piece is occupying are complete

Erase row(s), tally score, move location of all blocks above the row down 1 unit

Generate new piece, give control back to player


Maybe the render logic just looks at the color and location of every block and renders each frame that way?
